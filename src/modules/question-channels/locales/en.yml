# Help
embed_help_title: Question Channels

embed_help_field_ask_title: Ask
embed_help_field_ask_content: >
    Post your question into this channel and we will create a new one with your question at the top.

embed_help_field_format_title: Format
embed_help_field_format_content: >
    When your question uses multiple lines, the first one will be used as the **headline**. Note that **attachments** like images and other files **will be lost**. Send them into your new channel seperately.

embed_help_field_how_to_ask_title: How to ask a question
embed_help_field_how_to_ask_content: |
    **No Background Knowledge**
    Your question should not require any background knowledge about your project. Make sure that all information necessary to answer your question are included in your message.

    **Generality**
    State your question as general as possible. This is best explained by an example:
    :x: ``How to give a player 10 points?``
    :white_check_mark: ``How to increment the value of a variable in Javascript by 10?``
    In the first case the helper must deal with the context to answer the rather simple question. Hence the reduction to the essentials safes everyone time and effort.

    **Codeblocks**
    To make a question more comprehensible it makes sense to use [codeblocks](https://bit.ly/35OUUQ8). Large codeblocks (50+ Lines) should be uploaded to websites like [Codepen](https://codepen.io/) or [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/) to keep the message readable.

# Notification

embed_notification_field_solved_title: Problem solved?
embed_notification_field_solved_content: Great! React with {0} to the message which solved your problem and we will remove the question channel.

embed_notification_field_irrelevant_title: Question irrelevant?
embed_notification_field_irrelevant_content: Send {0} into your question channel to remove it yourself.
